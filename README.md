## My process
- I start with setting up all the required files and linking them
- write the html semantic with css, section by section rather than writing the html for the whole site, as it overwhelmes me.
- I like to work with 'em' as it keeps my code (DRY) while writing media queries.
- Change the fontsize in media queries for the body, since I used em previously, all the elements just fit in properly for all screen sizes.
- Try to write some common styles to reuse them.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
 Learnt how to use Overlay on a background image:
    - Basically nested the section inside a overlay container
